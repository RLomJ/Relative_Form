# Relative_Forms

The development of a Plug-In inspired by the relationship and commonality of embedded architectural space and forms as an exploration into the architectural principles of the interior vs the exterior as both an experience and design initiative. Initially based around Max Bruckner’s collection of simple and complex polyhedral and their dualities. The project has since developed into a conceptual understanding and application of the ideas of Robert Venturi and Sir John Soane, of the relationship of the part and whole of design. Inspired by Robert Venturi and his writing of Complexity and Contradiction in architecture and the ideas behind the contradiction of “the inside vs the outside” and the “ambiguity” of the design, alongside Sir John Soane’s compositions of interior views, an exploration of comparative views of smaller structures within larger structures that specifically focused on the idea of an embedded form being used to create a contradiction and represent the idea that architecture has space for more of itself. The main goal of the plug-in was focused on how traditional ideas behind the interior and exterior could be developed and explored differently when it came to the design as a whole. 

The plug-in allows the user to generate a set boundary condition, in which they will design exterior and interior forms of space, that will both be dependnet and derivative of one another but contrast in multiple ways.
